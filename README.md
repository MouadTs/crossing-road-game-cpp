A classic crossing road game implemented using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with the assistance of Qt Creator and its library.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate the timeless crossing road game where the player navigates a character across a busy road while avoiding obstacles. The game leverages C++ for its core logic and Qt Creator for graphical interface design, utilizing Qt's library for enhanced functionality and visual appeal.
